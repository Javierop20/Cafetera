## RFID Authentication in NodeMCU + Register on Google Spreadsheets

A NodeMCU based Authentication with RFID and register some data in the Google Drive Platform. 

It could be used as a form of register the entry of people to an office or the usage of a certain machine if you use a relay module (that's why it's called 'Cafetera').

Part of the code was taken from the examples of the RFID library and other parts were written by me. It has a few comments, and some serial output to help the programmer.
